My analyses and exploration of the dataset are included in this repository.
The goal was to predic and classify/calculate probability for who will file 
for car insurance claim based on a large data containing information on the 
driver, car, etc.

*I wrote those codes for my own learning purpose and abide by the code/data 
sharing rules of the competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction/rules)
